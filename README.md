# CI/CD Tools and Practices Final Project 


## Tasks

This project-based course was a deep dive into designing modern, cloud-native CI/CD pipelines — and it pushed me to apply what I’ve learned in a real-world DevOps workflow.

🛠️ Here’s what I built:

✅ A GitHub Actions CI pipeline with automated steps for flake8 linting and nose-based unit testing

✅ Tekton Tasks for linting, testing, and building Docker images — written from scratch in YAML

✅ An OpenShift CI Pipeline that reuses these Tekton tasks to automate the end-to-end build and test process

✅ A final deployment step that deploys the image to the lab OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift Client task and oc command
